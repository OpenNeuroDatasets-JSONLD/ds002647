OpenNeuro curator note: This dataset was previously accessible at ds002572. The dataset was reuploaded due to privacy considerations. 

The behavioral, functional and structural MRI data found in this repository have been published in:

Mather, M., Huang, R., Clewett, D.V., Nielsen, S., Velasco, R., Tu, K., Han, S., & Kennedy, B.L. (2020). Isometric exercise facilitates attention to salient events in women via the noradrenergic system. NeuroImage 210:116560

Additional pupillometry, behavioral, and subject data related to this project can be found in this OSF repository: https://osf.io/2y47s/?view_only=ff3af10779cb42a8a5b0e26620f81d4f.

Subject folders are labeled by their experiment id (e.g., "sub-101, sub-201, sub-301"). Subjects in the 100 series are LU (luteal phase younger women); 200 series are HC (hormonal contraceptive younger women); and 300 series are PM (post-menopausal older women).

Contained within the anat and func sub-folders for each subject are the following acquisitions (with a few exceptions described below):
1) anat (2 acquisitions) - T1-weighted anatomical image, T1 FSE (neuromelanin-weighted) image of the pontine brainstem slices

2) func (2 to 3 acquisitions) - Isometric Handgrip functional scan, Oddball task functional task (run 1), Oddball task functional scan (run 2, if acquired)

Notes:
After our first set of participants, data collection protocol was modified so that only one run of the oddball task was administered. The published study uses only oddball run 1; however, data from both runs (if available) are provided in the respository.
In participants.tsv, the "exclude" column tags subjects who were excluded from neuroimaging analyses in the published study. We recommend using the same exclusions when analyzing this dataset.

BIDS warnings:
Code 25 EVENTS_TSV_MISSING - Behavioral data missing for sub-101 (pilot participant) because some experiment programs were modified after piloting
Code 38 INCONSISTENT_SUBJECTS - Oddball run 2 acquisition files are missing for subjects who only did one run of the task
Code 39 INCONSISTENT_PARAMETERS - These 3 acquisitions were acquired during "pilot" before our scan sequences were modified. Thus, the inconsistency in dimensions.
